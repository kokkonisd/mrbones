<h2 id="building-a-simple-site"><a href="#building-a-simple-site">ii. building a simple site</a></h2>
<p>
    Let's get started by building a very simple site first, with only a simple index file:
</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir my-site/
$ cd my-site/
$ echo "hello, world" &gt; index.html
</pre>

<p>
    In order to build it, we simply invoke <code>mrbones</code>:
</p>

<pre>
$ mrbones
[mrbones]  Setting up output directory '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'...
[mrbones]  Copying site content...
[mrbones]  Generating pages...
[mrbones]  Done! Site is ready at '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'.
</pre>

<div class="note">
    <p>
        <code>mrbones</code> takes one argument: the path to the source directory of the site. If
        no argument is provided, then the <b>current directory</b> is used by default.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    If we look at <code>_site</code>, not much seems to have happened; <code>mrbones</code> simply
    copies our <code>index.html</code> file over.
</p>

<pre>
$ ls _site/
index.html
$ cat _site/index.html
hello, world
</pre>

<p>
    Let's add some more files. For example, maybe our site has various assets, such as CSS files, or
    even static files like text or images:
</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir assets/ css/
$ echo "hello" &gt; assets/message.txt
$ echo "body { font-size: 16pt; }" &gt; css/main.css
</pre>

<p>
    If we build the site again, we will observe that <code>mrbones</code> has simply moved all of
    our files to the <code>_site</code> directory, in their corresponding directories. This is
    because the site does not make use of any special features of <code>mrbones</code> for now.
    Let's change that by adding another page:
</p>

<pre>
$ echo "today I made a site" &gt; news.html
$ mrbones
[mrbones]  Setting up output directory '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'...
[mrbones]  Copying site content...
[mrbones]  Generating pages...
[mrbones]  Done! Site is ready at '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'.
$ ls _site
assets css index.html news news.html
$ ls _site/news
index.html
</pre>

<p>
    It seems that <code>mrbones</code> did not only copy over <code>news.html</code>, but also
    created a copy of it which it placed at <code>news/index.html</code>. In fact, we can
    see this information if we build the site in verbose mode:
</p>

<pre>
$ mrbones --verbose
[mrbones]  Setting up output directory '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'...
[mrbones]    Removing '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site/'...
[mrbones]    Creating '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site/'...
[mrbones]  Copying site content...
[mrbones]  Generating pages...
[mrbones]    Generating page 'index.html'...
[mrbones]      Putting page in '_site/index.html'...
[mrbones]    Generating page 'news.html'...
[mrbones]      Putting page in '_site/news.html'...
[mrbones]      Creating page copy in '_site/news/index.html'...
[mrbones]  Done! Site is ready at '/home/plumtrie/my-site/_site'.
</pre>

<p>
    This is done automatically to allow endpoints to be more lenient when serving the site. That
    way, when a user visits <code>/news</code> (as opposed to <code>/news.html</code>, they will be
    served <code>_site/news/index.html</code> instead of getting a 404 error.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <p>
        <code>mrbones</code> treats files ending in <code>.html</code> or <code>.htm</code>
        differently, as we will see in the <a href="#using-directives">directives</a> section. It
        copies everything else over as-is, and completely ignores everything in the
        <code>_templates/</code> directory.
    </p>
</div>
